{"problems": "Alice and Bob each created one problem for HackerRank. A reviewer rates the two challenges, awarding points on a scale from to for three categories: problem clarity , originality , and difficulty . We define the rating for Alice's challenge to be the triplet , and the rating for Bob's challenge to be the triplet . Your task is to find their comparison points by comparing with , with , and with . If , then Alice is awarded point. If , then Bob is awarded point. If , then neither person receives a point. Comparison points is the total points a person earned. Given and , determine their respective comparison points. For example, and . For elements , Bob is awarded a point because . For the equal elements and , no points are earned. Finally, for elements , so Alice receives a point. Your return array would be with Alice's score first and Bob's second. Function Description Complete the function compareTriplets in the editor below. It must return an array of two integers, the first being Alice's score and the second being Bob's. compareTriplets has the following parameter(s): a : an array of integers representing Alice's challenge rating b : an array of integers representing Bob's challenge rating"},
{"problems": "Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large. Function Description Complete the aVeryBigSum function in the editor below. It must return the sum of all array elements. aVeryBigSum has the following parameter(s): ar : an array of integers . Input Format The first line of the input consists of an integer . The next line contains space-separated integers contained in the array. Output Format Print the integer sum of the elements in the array. Constraints Sample Input Output Note: The range of the 32-bit integer is . When we add several integer values, the resulting sum might exceed the above range. You might need to use long long int in C/C++ or long data type in Java to store such sums."},
{"problems": "Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals. For example, the square matrix is shown below: The left-to-right diagonal = . The right to left diagonal = . Their absolute difference is . Function description Complete the function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference. diagonalDifference takes the following parameter: arr : an array of integers ."},
{"problems": "Given an array of integers, calculate the fractions of its elements that are positive , negative , and are zeros . Print the decimal value of each fraction on a new line. Note: This challenge introduces precision problems. The test cases are scaled to six decimal places, though answers with absolute error of up to are acceptable. For example, given the array there are elements, two positive, two negative and one zero. Their ratios would be , and . It should be printed as Function Description Complete the plusMinus function in the editor below. It should print out the ratio of positive, negative and zero items in the array, each on a separate line rounded to six decimals. plusMinus has the following parameter(s): arr : an array of integers"}
